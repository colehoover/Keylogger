<h1>Keylogger in Python</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a simple keylogger written in Python. The keylogger will log your keystrokes and write them to a text file that is formatted for easier readability. I am planning to add features like emailing you the logged keystrokes and more in the future.
